##### Sherlock Scenario

Your manager has just informed you that, due to recent budget cuts, you'll need to take on additional responsibilities in threat analysis. As a junior threat intelligence analyst at a cybersecurity firm, you're now tasked with investigating a cyber espionage campaign linked to a group known as Salt Typhoon. Apparently, defending against sophisticated Nation-State cyber threats is now a "do more with less" kind of game. Your Task: Conduct comprehensive research on Salt Typhoon, focusing on their tactics, techniques, and procedures. Utilize the MITRE ATT&CK framework to map out their activities and provide actionable insights. Your findings could play a pivotal role in fortifying our defenses against this adversary. Dive deep into the data and show that even with a shoestring budget, you can outsmart the cyber baddies.
