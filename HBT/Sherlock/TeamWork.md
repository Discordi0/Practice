##### Sherlock Scenario

It is Friday afternoon and the SOC at Edny Consulting Ltd has received alerts from the workstation of Jason Longfield, a software engineer on the development team, regarding the execution of some discovery commands. Jason has just gone on holiday and is not available by phone. The workstation appears to have been switched off, so the only evidence we have at the moment is an export of his mailbox containing today's messages. As the company was recently the victim of a supply chain attack, this case is being taken seriously and the Cyber Threat Intelligence team is being called in to determine the severity of the threat.
