##### Sherlock Scenario

One of the Forela WordPress servers was a target of notorious Threat Actors (TA). The website was running a blog dedicated to the Forela Social Club, where Forela employees can chat and discuss random topics. Unfortunately, it became a target of a threat group. The SOC team believe this was due to the blog running a vulnerable plugin. The IT admin already followed the acquisition playbook and triaged the server for the security team. Ultimately (no pun intended) it is your responsibility to investigate the incident. Step in and confirm the culprits behind the attack and restore this important service within the Forela environment.
