`Overpass-the-Hash (Pass-the-Key)` is a type of attack where an adversary gains unauthorized access to resources by using a stolen `NTLM (NT LAN Manager)` hash or Kerberos key, without needing to crack the password from which the hash was derived. The attack involves using the hash to create a `Kerberos TGT (Ticket-Granting Ticket)` to authenticate to Active Directory (AD).

When the adversary utilizes Overpass-the-Hash, they have the `NTLM` hash of the user's password, which is used to craft an `AS-REQ (Authentication Service Request)` to the `Key Distribution Center (KDC)`. To appear authentic, the `AS-REQ` contains a `PRE-AUTH` field, which contains an encrypted timestamp (`Enc-Timestamp`). This is normally used by a legitimate client to prove knowledge of the user's password, as it is encrypted using the user's password hash. In this attack scenario, the hash used to encrypt the timestamp is not derived from the actual password but rather it is the stolen NTLM hash. More specifically, in an `Overpass-the-Hash` attack the attacker doesn't use this hash to encrypt the `Enc-Timestamp`. Instead, the attacker directly uses the stolen NTLM hash to compute the Kerberos `AS-REQ`, bypassing the usual Kerberos process that would involve the user's password and the `Enc-Timestamp`. The attacker essentially "overpasses" the normal password-based authentication process, hence the name Overpass-the-Hash.

One key aspect of this type of attack that we can leverage for detection is the `encryption type` used for the `Enc-Timestamp`. A standard `AS-REQ` from a modern Windows client will usually use the `AES256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96` encryption type for the Enc-Timestamp, but an `Overpass-the-Hash` attack using the older NTLM hash will use the `RC4-HMAC` encryption type. This discrepancy can be used as an indicator of a potential attack.

Review the previously referenced resource that discusses the network traces resulting from executing an `Overpass-the-Hash` attack, and then proceed to address the following question.

Q: There is a file named wannamine.pcap in the /home/htb-student/pcaps directory, which contains network traffic related to the Overpass-the-hash technique which involves Kerberos encryption type downgrading. Replace XX with the appropriate value in the last content keyword of the rule with sid XXXXXXX within the local.rules file so that an alert is triggered as your answer.
